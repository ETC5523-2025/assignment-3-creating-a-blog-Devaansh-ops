Welcome! I'm **Devaansh Gupta**, a storyteller who speaks in numbers and visualizations. This portfolio showcases how data can illuminate critical issues—from climate catastrophes to everyday mysteries.

## Burning Point: Climate, Data, and Responsibility

Australia's Black Summer bushfires weren't just a natural disaster—they were a wake-up call. Through statistical analysis and climate modeling, I explore how human-induced warming made these catastrophic fires **at least 30% more likely**.

**Key Findings:**

-   🔥 Fire Weather Index values hit 1,000-year return periods

-   🌡️ Temperatures 1-2°C warmer than 1900 baseline

-   📈 4-8x higher risk projected at 2°C global warming

## 👋 About Me

When I'm not transforming data into insights, you'll find me writing, singing, playing badminton, or trekking through nature. I believe that **curiosity and creativity** are just as essential to analysis as logic and precision.

Currently pursuing my Master of Business Analytics, I'm passionate about uncovering narratives hidden in datasets and making complex information accessible to everyone.
