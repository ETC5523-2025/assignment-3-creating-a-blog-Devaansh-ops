Hello! I'm a 22-year-old student who is enthusiastic in finding narratives in data.  
I'm investigating how statistics may explain and sometimes even predict real-world occurrences as I work for my **Master of Business Analytics**.
You can find me **writing, singing, playing badminton**, or going on **a trek** to refuel when I'm not buried in datasets. In my opinion, the importance of imagination and curiosity in analysis is equal to that of logic and accuracy.
